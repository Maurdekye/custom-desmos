# custom-desmos
A quick custom webapp extension of the Desmos graphing calculator API, adding a handful of additional useful features.

* Allows bulk copying of LaTeX source in and out of the calculator.
* Options for auto-arranging into properly formatted `align` and `flalign` LaTeX markdown blocks.
* Clear equations button.
* Disable graphpaper checkbox, in case you need that extra horizontal space for long equations.
* Sliders to adjust the x and y graph scale indpendently, a feature on the mobile app version that's missing from the desktop site.
* hidden feature: the Reverse Contrast option in the calculator will invert the custom control colors as well.

Features a responsive flexbox UI, to facilitate use on mobile.

This app uses the default developer Desmos API key, so don't go distributing this around your office/classroom before swapping that out. I made this mostly for my personal use, so any issues you come across are not my responsibility, use at your own risk, etc.
