# custom-desmos
A quick custom webapp extension of the Desmos graphing calculator API, adding a handful of additional useful features.

* Allows bulk copying of LaTeX source in and out of the calculator.
* Options for auto-arranging into properly formatted `align` and `flalign` LaTeX markdown blocks.
* Clear equations button.
* Disable graphpaper checkbox, in case you need that extra horizontal space for long equations.
* Sliders to adjust the x and y graph scale indpendently, a feature on the mobile app version that's missing from the desktop site.
* hidden feature: the Reverse Contrast option in the calculator will invert the custom control colors as well.

Features a scalable flexbox ui framework, to facilitate use on mobile.
